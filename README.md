# Qt5 Examples & Templates

My goals on this repository:

* Create sample apps using C++ with Qt5.
* Learn more Python and create sample apps using PyQt (also move away from C++).
* Create my own components, which have custom rendering.
* Create at least one app with PyQt that has multiple views with several types of components, such as:
 * Graphs
 * Tables
 * Loading gifs before displaying a view or data
 * Use reactive programming as the main asynchronous mechanism
 * 3D animations
 * Video player
 * `What you see is what you get` textarea editor (the ones where you can use formatting, etc)
